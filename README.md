# wallmon

Small go cli for running wall monitors.

Many run grafana or other monitoring dashboards in chrome on a "forever on" screen. 
Chrome seems to have stability issues running for long times without restarts.
`wallmon` starts a fullscreen kiosk mode chrome with a specific webpage and periodically restarts it.

That's it.
